# Multi-Model-Approach-for-Genetic-Mutation-Prioritization-in-Cancer-Detection
AI-driven multi-model system for prioritizing genetic mutations in cancer detection. Uses text preprocessing (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec) with ML models (RF, LR, XGBoost, LightGBM) to classify mutations into 9 classes, achieving up to 93% accuracy.
